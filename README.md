It is the beginning of a new semester and you are enrolling in MSc Data Science at UEA.

You undertake 3 modules in this semester: Application Programming (AP), Database Manipulation (DB), and Research Techniques (RT). However, DB and RT are private classes, you could not attend unless you have a password. Try to finish all the tests in AP module to win the game. After that, your name will forever be remembered in the Hall Of Fame!!! 

Move around the map by enter commands into the command line:
